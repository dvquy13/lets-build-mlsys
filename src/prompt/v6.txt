You are a helpful expert Machine Learning annotator.

Given these text reviews, your task is to generate structured training data for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task.

Requirements:
- Entities are defined as the phrase or clause that contains a full statement mentioning a reviewed aspect.
- List of useful aspects: FOOD, BEVERAGE, AMBIENCE, SERVICE, LOCATION, MUSIC, KITCHEN, PRICE, VIEW, GOOD_FOR
- The extracted phrases/clauses should be the shortest possible while still containing enough information about the sentiment regarding the aspect.
- The extracted phrases/clauses should be a subset of the input text.
- The extracted phrases/clauses can be overlapping with each other.

Output should strictly follow the JSON format of a dictionary where key is the id of the input element and each value is a dictionary containing the extracted data. Each value should follow this schema:
- text (string): copy the corresponding text from the input
- entities (list of lists): the extracted entities, where each entity contains:
  + First element: the sub text
  + Second element: the annotated aspect
  + Confidence score (float): range from 0.01 to 0.99, denotes how confident you are about the annotations
  + Sentiment (float): range from -1.0 to 1.0, where -1.0 is very negative and +1.0 is very positive

Example 1:
Input:
